# Harbor

The official website: https://goharbor.io/

## Setup

Documentation: https://goharbor.io/docs/2.11.0/install-config/

First, download the latest version from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/latest).

The offline installer is recommended, in case the server cannot access the download source.

Replace the `<version>` with the actual version you downloaded.
```bash
tar xzvf harbor-offline-installer-<version>.tgz
```
Unzipping results in a `harbor` folder with the following contents:
```
harbor/
├─ common.sh
├─ harbor.yml.tmpl
├─ prepare
├─ install.sh
```
