# Kubernetes

## Self-hosted Kubernetes

Following this [handbook](https://www.karsonjo.com/deploy-a-self-hosted-kubernetes/) in Chinese.

### [Install kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)

### [Required ports](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/)

When running Kubernetes in an environment with strict network boundaries, such 
as on-premises datacenter with physical network firewalls or Virtual 
Networks in Public Cloud, it is useful to be aware of the ports and protocols 
used by Kubernetes components.

### Control plane (Master)

| Protocol | Direction | Port Range | Purpose                 | Used By                   |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| TCP      | Inbound   | 6443       | Kubernetes API server   | All                       |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 2379-2380  | etcd server client API  | kube-apiserver, etcd      |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10250      | Kubelet API             | Self, Control plane       |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10259      | kube-scheduler          | Self                      |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10257      | kube-controller-manager | Self                      |

Although etcd ports are included in control plane section, you can also host your own.
etcd cluster externally or on custom ports. 

On Ubuntu, you should configure the `ufw`(Ubuntu firewall) to allow the ports.

```bash
for p in "6443/tcp" "2379:2380/tcp" "10250/tcp" "10259/tcp" "10257/tcp"; do sudo ufw allow "$p"; done
```


### Worker node(s)

| Protocol | Direction | Port Range  | Purpose               | Used By                 |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10250       | Kubelet API           | Self, Control plane     |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10256       | kube-proxy            | Self, Load balancers    |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 30000-32767 | NodePort Services     | All                     |

â€  Default port range for [NodePort Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

All default port numbers can be overridden. When custom ports are used those 
ports need to be open instead of defaults mentioned here. 

On Ubuntu, you should configure the `ufw`(Ubuntu firewall) to allow the ports.
```bash
for p in "10250/tcp" "10256/tcp" "30000:32767/tcp"; do sudo ufw allow "$p"; done
```

One common example is API server port that is sometimes switched
to 443. Alternatively, the default port is kept as is and API server is put 
behind a load balancer that listens on 443 and routes the requests to API server
on the default port.
