## Registry Mirrors

If you live in mainland China, you may face network issues about the connectivity to the [official Docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/).


You can configure the registry mirrors settings of Docker.

For example, Tencent cloud Docker registry mirror: https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com.


On Linux, run the code below to edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and copy paste the following content.

```json
{
   "registry-mirrors": [
   "https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com"
  ]
}
```

Note: If you face permission issues, edit the file with `sudo`.
